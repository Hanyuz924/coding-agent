Review the code or pull request and provide structured feedback.

## Steps

1. Understand the scope:
   - If a PR number or URL is given in $ARGUMENTS, use `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --patch` to get the diff.
   - Otherwise, use `git diff main...HEAD` (or `git diff HEAD~1`) for local changes.
2. Analyze the diff:
   - Correctness: Are there bugs, edge cases, or logic errors?
   - Security: Injection, auth issues, exposed secrets, unsafe operations?
   - Performance: N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, blocking calls?
   - Style: Does it follow existing conventions in the codebase?
   - Tests: Are new behaviors tested? Do existing tests cover the change?
3. Write a structured review:
   ```
   ## Summary
   One-line overview of what the change does.

   ## Issues
   - [CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR] Description and location

   ## Suggestions
   - Nice-to-have improvements

   ## Verdict
   APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / COMMENT
   ```
4. If changes are needed, list specific file:line references.
